## Introduction

Qt is a set of C++ libraries and development tools that includes platform independent abstractions for graphical user interfaces, networking, threads, regular expressions, SQL databases, SVG, OpenGL, XML, user and application settings, positioning and location services, short range communications (NFC and Bluetooth), web browsing, 3D animation, charts, 3D data visualisation and interfacing with app stores. PyQt5 implements over 1000 of these classes as a set of Python modules.

PyQt5 supports the Windows, Linux, UNIX, Android, macOS and iOS platforms.

PyQt does not include a copy of Qt. You must obtain a correctly licensed copy of Qt yourself. However, binary wheels of the GPL version of PyQt5 are provided and these include a copy of the appropriate parts of the LGPL version of Qt.

The homepage for PyQt5 is https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/. Here you will always find the latest stable version, current development previews, and the latest version of this documentation.

PyQt5 is built using the SIP bindings generator. SIP must be installed in order to build and use PyQt5.

Earlier versions of Qt are supported by PyQt4.
